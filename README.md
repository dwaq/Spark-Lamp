Spark-Lamp
==========

Uses a Spark core and a 433 Mhz transmitter to wirelessly control lamps

Two buttons connected as inputs toggle two individual lamps. A third input reads the room's lightswitch state and sets both lamps correspondingly.

Also allows the states to be read and changed over Wi-Fi.
